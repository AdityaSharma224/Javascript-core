Lifeline lite - 
I am part of customer support tech team, and we have a dashboard for agent where there can
work on issues and tickets that came from customers and merchant side of the business
so in ticket view we have an option where onboarded tenant can ask for customized window
so there they can add personalized window. so that personalized window is lifeline lite

 So the problem statement was -
 Agents had to manually open multiple tabs and systems to gather 
 customer information during live conversations. 
 This caused context switching, slowed down decision-making,
 and increased ticket resolution time. Because critical 
 details were scattered across different tools, agents 
 spent significant time searching for the right customer 
 data instead of focusing on resolving the issue.

how - 
We integrated with the client API to fetch all 
relevant customer data in real time as soon as an agent opened a conversation.
now the messages handling and to get the context of the conversation we have used LLM's and through
full duplex connection through mqtt we passed that data throght props to the component I built.
I structured the UI using a modular component architecture, where each section (customer profile, 
past tickets, plan info, eligibility, etc.) was its own component that updated based on changing props.

To make the interface contextual, the components were built to adapt 
dynamically based on the conversation flow — for example, showing 
different sections or highlighting critical data depending on the agent’s current step.
To avoid unnecessary re-renders, I used React optimization techniques such as:
memo() for pure components useCallback and useMemo for stable functions and derived data

Lazy loading of non-critical sections
Conditional rendering depending on API state
The result was a smooth, real-time UI where data updated instantly without lag, 
and only the required components re-rendered.
