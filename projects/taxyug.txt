During my graduation, a few chartered accountant friends shared how many 
people struggled with filing ITR and GST. They suggested 
I build a simple platform where they could offer reliable tax services. 
That conversation inspired me to create TaxYug—a clean,
fast, SEO-optimized website that simplifies taxes for everyone.

What TaxYug Does

✔ ITR Filing (all types)
✔ GST Filing
✔ HUF Registration

Offers additional tools like:

✔ Free Tax Calculators

The platform is focused on simplicity, reliability, and affordability.
