Challenges –
It was the Lifeline Lite that I recently delivered.
Because it required building a real-time LCM-driven, 
contextual dashboard that updates continuously while 
staying performant. Integrating multiple APIs & streaming 
conversation context through Mott and design dynamic 
UI that adapts agent workflow introduced significantly.

I had to architect the UI modularity, 
optimize rendering and ensure a smooth 
experience despite constant data updates.
Choosing the most efficient and scalable 
approach among many options made the 
task even more demanding.

To scale this feature without 
breaking the larger dashboard ecosystem.
I adapted micro-frontend principles.

Each major section like
– profile, tickets, plan info, order history
functioned like its own isolated mini-app.
– independent rendering & state boundaries prevent massive parent re-renders.
– arch allowed embedded without tightly coupled into the main dashboard.
– team now can inst future widgets without touching existing modules.

→ Lazy loading
→ Contextual conditional rendering
→ Derived UI state
