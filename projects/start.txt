I am a frontend developer currently working in Zomato, 
which is India’s largest online food ordering app.
So I am a part of the Customer Support team, a web platform 
where agents that are stakeholder of business work on 
resolving customers’ or merchants’ tickets. 
Here my day-to-day work is to work on client requirements
 and build custom dashboards and features from scratch.
So here I take care of proper optimizations and accountability 
of the feature I am working on.

Before Zomato I also worked at Cast as a frontend developer. 
There I was specifically hired to create a desktop application 
completely from scratch. So I created a desktop app built on top 
of Wails framework, UI is completely React and backend was Go. 
So there I also worked with international teams and owned and 
developed application end-to-end. And later on I also revamped 
their SaaS customer-facing webpage and did some optimizations. 
Apart from this I also did some internships when I was in college 
as an MTS intern at GFG. So there I authored widely read articles 
on DSA that are available on internet today and these are now 
search-indexed articles in their category.

why looking for a change ?
So there majorly two major reasons - 
I joined Zomato with a clear understanding of the team and 
type of work I’d be contributing to. I was hired for core Zomato 
and after I joined there was an internal restructuring, and 
I was moved to a new vertical  where the working style, processes,
and structure are very different from what I initially signed up for. 
The environment is quite fluid, with frequent changes and limited clarity or 
planning. While I’ve adapted and delivered, I feel the setup 
doesn’t fully align with the way I work best or the kind of 
engineering culture I’m looking for.
I’m now looking for a role where there is more stability, 
clearer roadmaps, and a more structured product + engineering 
collaboration, so I can contribute more effectively and grow in 
the right direction
