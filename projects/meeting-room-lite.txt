This app is a real-time video conferencing platform similar to Zoom, 
built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Peer.js. 
When a user visits the homepage, they are automatically 
redirected to a unique meeting room using a randomly generated UUID. 
The backend manages these rooms and handles WebSocket-based real-time 
communication using Socket.io.

Once inside a room, users can stream video and audio using WebRTC, 
which is facilitated by Peer.js for peer-to-peer connections. 
The app also includes a text chat feature, where messages are 
sent and received in real time via Socket.io.

Users have controls to mute/unmute their microphone and start/stop 
their video feed. When so meone leaves, their video stream is removed, 
and connections are properly closed. The frontend is built using EJS templates,
Bootstrap for styling, and jQuery for interactivity,
ensuring a smooth user experience.
The app runs on port 433 but can be deployed on any server.


Socket.io
A library used for real-time, bi-directional communication between client and server.
Works over WebSockets but falls back to other protocols if needed, ensuring reliability.
Ideal for chat apps, video calling, multiplayer games, collaborative tools.
Provides automatic reconnection, room management, and event-based messaging.

WebRTC
Stands for Web Real-Time Communication.
A browser-native technology that allows peer-to-peer 
audio/video streaming without needing plugins.
Used for video calls, screen sharing, and real-time media transfer.
Handles audio/video capture, encoding, NAT traversal (via STUN/TURN servers), 
and encrypted media transport.
