not everone use html,css,js to build website
you replace -> js with TS, html with react, and some css processor

not doing anything from scratch

and the end there will to many name collisions and massive to big file and then you will create lots of polyfills so that your can provide native supports to legacy browsers.

so here is comes the work of bundlers like webpack

what is module bundler ?
1. take multiple js file combine then and make single big file

Webpack bridges the gap between your modern developer workflow and what browsers actually understand, while optimizing everything for performance and scalability.

In modern web development, you typically:

Write modular code (multiple JS/TS files)
Use modern JS syntax (ES6+, JSX, TypeScript)
Import CSS, images, fonts directly in your JS
Use npm packages (React, Lodash, etc.)
➡️ The browser doesn’t understand all of that directly.

✅ Why Webpack is Important
1. Module Bundling
Converts multiple .js, .css, .ts, etc., files into one or more optimized bundles.

Keeps code modular during development, bundles it efficiently for production.

2. Compatibility & Transpiling
Works with Babel or TypeScript to convert modern code (ES6+, JSX, TS) into browser-compatible JS.

3. Asset Management
Import and bundle images, fonts, and stylesheets directly in JS.

Handles compression and cache-busting (e.g., bundle.abc123.js).

4. Development Experience
Features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) make development fast and smooth.

Automatically rebuilds and refreshes your app as you code.

5. Performance Optimization
Tree-shaking removes dead code.

Code splitting improves loading time by loading only what’s needed.

Minification shrinks your JS/CSS size.
