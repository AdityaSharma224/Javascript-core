Evaluating a UI (What Makes a UI Good or Bad?)
Good UI Principles:

Clarity & Simplicity: The design should be intuitive, with a clear hierarchy.
Consistency: Maintain uniformity in fonts, colors, spacing, and interactions.
Accessibility: Ensure the UI is usable for people with disabilities (ARIA attributes, proper contrast, keyboard navigation).
Performance: Fast-loading, smooth animations, and responsive design.
Feedback & Error Handling: Proper validation, helpful error messages, and immediate user feedback.
Bad UI Examples:

Cluttered Design: Too much information or elements overwhelming the user.
Inconsistent Interactions: Different styles and interactions for similar actions.
Slow Performance: Heavy, unoptimized assets, blocking UI elements.
Confusing Navigation: Hard-to-find elements, lack of breadcrumbs or back functionality.
