This app is a real-time video conferencing platform similar to Zoom, 
built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Peer.js. 
When a user visits the homepage, they are automatically 
redirected to a unique meeting room using a randomly generated UUID. 
The backend manages these rooms and handles WebSocket-based real-time 
communication using Socket.io.

Once inside a room, users can stream video and audio using WebRTC, 
which is facilitated by Peer.js for peer-to-peer connections. 
When a new participant joins, they notify others in the room, 
and their video stream is added to the interface dynamically. 
The app also includes a text chat feature, where messages are 
sent and received in real time via Socket.io.

Users have controls to mute/unmute their microphone and start/stop 
their video feed. When someone leaves, their video stream is removed, 
and connections are properly closed. The frontend is built using EJS templates, 
Bootstrap for styling, and jQuery for interactivity, 
ensuring a smooth user experience. 
The app runs on port 433 but can be deployed on any server.
