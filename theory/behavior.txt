Career history - 

So currently I am working in Zomato as Frontend developer and it's been 4 months
I am basically part of nugget team that takes care of or handles the customer support of zomato and blinkit.
earlier it was yes one support but since the product has lot of potential so now it's available for other clients as well
and we are providing this serivce to other businesses as well in subscription basis. so here I am
working on new projects and client requirements. Before zomato I have also worked at CAST, Bengaluru as frontend 
developer that was the first time when I worked exclusively
on frontend and yeah I was specifically hired to build a desktop application UI from the very scratch.
So that desktop application I built using react js and for OS executable we'have used wails framework.
So yes i was kind of founding UI developer of that application and apart from this I have also revamped there 
SaaS application UI. I worked there for almost 1 year 11 months. and before all this I also did some 
internships one in contlo as backend intern for 3 months and one in geeksforgeeks as MTS intern for 7 
months there I worked under core DSA team and that was probably my best experience. So all these 
internships i completed in college time.

I joined Zomato with a clear understanding of the team and 
type of work I’d be contributing to. However, there was 
an internal restructuring, and I was moved to a new vertical 
where the working style, processes, and structure are very 
different from what I initially signed up for. The environment 
is quite fluid, with frequent changes and limited clarity or 
planning. While I’ve adapted and delivered, I feel the setup 
doesn’t fully align with the way I work best or the kind of 
engineering culture I’m looking for.
I’m now looking for a role where there is more stability, 
clearer roadmaps, and a more structured product + engineering 
collaboration, so I can contribute more effectively and grow in 
the right direction

OTP - 
Situtaion was - Users were repeatedly requesting OTP's, causing load on
authentication service. so the task was to introduce a reliable controlled
resend OTP flow.
I developed and deployed a resend OTP feature a 30 second cooldown.
that resulted in improved login success rate and now user won't be able to spam with requets.

Lifeline lite - 
So in nugget basically in ticket view we have an option where onboarded tenant can ask for customized window
so there they can personalized component. so that personalized component is lifeline lite

 So the problem statement was -
 Agents had to manually open multiple tabs and systems to gather 
 customer information during live conversations. 
 This caused context switching, slowed down decision-making,
 and increased ticket resolution time. Because critical 
 details were scattered across different tools, agents 
 spent significant time searching for the right customer 
 data instead of focusing on resolving the issue.

how - 
We integrated with the client API to fetch all 
relevant customer data in real time as soon as an agent opened a conversation.
now the messages handling and to get the context of the conversation we have used LLM's and through
full duplex connection through mqtt we passed that data throght props to the component I built.
I structured the UI using a modular component architecture, where each section (customer profile, 
past tickets, plan info, eligibility, etc.) was its own component that updated based on changing props.

To make the interface contextual, the components were built to adapt 
dynamically based on the conversation flow — for example, showing 
different sections or highlighting critical data depending on the agent’s current step.
To avoid unnecessary re-renders, I used React optimization techniques such as:
memo() for pure components useCallback and useMemo for stable functions and derived data

Lazy loading of non-critical sections
Conditional rendering depending on API state
The result was a smooth, real-time UI where data updated instantly without lag, 
and only the required components re-rendered.

challenging task ?
That's probably the recent feature I shipped in nugget the lifeline dashboard becase 
to display data contexually on ui there are so many ways to do that. 
but again we had to choose the easy and most efficient approach.
Challenge: One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to 
an international team. Working across different time zones, 
coordinating with diverse stakeholders, and aligning with global 
workflows required a shift in how I approached communication and collaboration.
Strategy: To ensure efficiency, I structured my work with clear documentation,
proactive communication, and async updates. I optimized my routine by 
aligning overlapping working hours for key discussions, leveraging 
detailed progress tracking to keep everyone informed, and making the 
most of async tools for collaboration. Over time, this helped me seamlessly 
integrate into the team, improving my productivity and contribution to the project.

Challenge: Enhancing long-term memory capabilities in AI models
was a significant challenge, as the system often struggled 
with response relevance and accuracy.
Strategy: I tackled this by integrating vector storage databases 
and optimizing retrieval mechanisms. Instead of relying on static 
memory, I designed a more dynamic approach that improved response 
relevance by 65%, ensuring better AI-driven interactions.

"At each step, I focused on breaking down problems into smaller components,
collaborating where necessary, and iterating towards an optimal solution.
These experiences have strengthened my ability to approach complex challenges strategically."

Why change ?
 

why linkedIn ?
So the reason is largely personal, I have used linkedin
alot and one more quite interesting thing linkedin played a very significant role
in my Career I created a very good network I would say and becasue of this platform
I reached out to the people and cracked many internships and one more thing
linkedin is only social/proffesional platform where i am available.
I do not have any instagram, facebook or snapchat.
I see LinkedIn as an ideal place where I can contribute to impactful
solutions that help millions of users connect, learn, and grow.

Next 5 years ?
I totally see myself advancing into a senior or leadership role
in the same company, where i can contribute not just as a developerbut also
as a mentor to my juniors and a decesion maker.

strength-
1. quick learning ability - i am very diverse when it comes to new
techno and learning new techno.
2. time management - I manage my time very efficiently this skill i
earned while working with internal teams.
3. communication and collaboration - I am also good at collaboration woking with multiple teams

weekness-
1. some times I take on too many tasks myself rather than delegating it to others
2.  Sometimes, I spend too much time refining details, which can slow down progress.
