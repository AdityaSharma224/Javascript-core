Career history - 
I started my careers when I was in 3rd year and one when 
I was sitting in my college library I got a call of recruiter from gfg.
that my profile is shortlisted for a dsa oriented role based on my gfg profile
as I was in top 10 in college then after some interview rounds I got selected
and in gfg basically I worked with dsa team and so the best thing about gfg is the culture
I spend 7 months working there and I didn't even felt how quick 
colaborated with marketing, design and cources team.
I used to author dsa tutorails, general handbook and articles.
so the work was tottaly around DSA.
and they also offered me full-time opportunity as well but since that was
content work so I joined a contlo as backend intern and I worked on enhancing the response
of AI agents so there was work around thinking capability. 
I worked there for 3 months cause I figured out that my interest is more on UI side.
because I find UI is blend of creativity and problem solving.
so I switched to CAST and here I am full-stack developer but frontend heavy
in my current company I am working with international teams so my team lead, my
reporting manager and PMs are working from france office.

challenging task ?
"Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve faced multiple challenges that pushed me to grow,
and I tackled each one with a structured and adaptable approach."

Challenge: One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to 
an international team. Working across different time zones, 
coordinating with diverse stakeholders, and aligning with global 
workflows required a shift in how I approached communication and collaboration.
Strategy: To ensure efficiency, I structured my work with clear documentation,
proactive communication, and async updates. I optimized my routine by 
aligning overlapping working hours for key discussions, leveraging 
detailed progress tracking to keep everyone informed, and making the 
most of async tools for collaboration. Over time, this helped me seamlessly 
integrate into the team, improving my productivity and contribution to the project.

Why change ?
To further enhance my skills, take on more challenging projects
and contribute to some more impactful work.
In my current role i have gained a valueable experience with a very good feedback.
but the thing is work here is very stegnant nowadays.

why linkedIn ?
So the reason is largely personal, I have used linkedin
alot and one more quite interesting thing linkedin played a very significant role
in my Career I created a very good network I would say and becasue of this platform
I reached out to the people and cracked many internships and one more thing
linkedin is only social/proffesional platform where i am available.
I do not have any instagram, facebook or snapchat.
I see LinkedIn as an ideal place where I can contribute to impactful
solutions that help millions of users connect, learn, and grow.

Challenge: Enhancing long-term memory capabilities in AI models
was a significant challenge, as the system often struggled 
with response relevance and accuracy.
Strategy: I tackled this by integrating vector storage databases 
and optimizing retrieval mechanisms. Instead of relying on static 
memory, I designed a more dynamic approach that improved response 
relevance by 65%, ensuring better AI-driven interactions.

"At each step, I focused on breaking down problems into smaller components,
collaborating where necessary, and iterating towards an optimal solution.
These experiences have strengthened my ability to approach complex challenges strategically."

Next 5 years ?
I totally see myself advancing into a senior or leadership role
in the same company, where i can contribute not just as a developerbut also
as a mentor to my juniors and a decesion maker.
