Career history - 
I started my careers when I was in 3rd year and one when 
I was sitting in my college library I got a call of recruiter from gfg.
that my profile is shortlisted for a dsa oriented role based on my gfg profile
as I was in top 10 in college then after some interview rounds I got selected
and in gfg basically I worked with dsa team and so the best thing about gfg is the culture
I spend 7 months working there and I didn't even felt how quick 
colaborated with marketing, design and cources team.
I used to author dsa tutorails, general handbook and articles.
so the work was tottaly around DSA.
and they also offered me full-time opportunity as well but since that was
content work so I joined a contlo as backend intern and I worked on enhancing the response
of AI agents so there was work around thinking capability. 
I worked there for 3 months cause I figured out that my interest is more on UI side.
because I find UI is blend of creativity and problem solving.
so I switched to CAST and here I am full-stack developer but frontend heavy
in my current company I am working with international teams so my team lead, my
reporting manager and PMs are working from france office.

Why change ?
To further enhance my skills, take on more challenging projects
and contribute to some more impactful work.
In my current role i have gained a valueable experience with a very good feedback.
but the thing is work here is very stegnant nowadays.

why linkedIn ?
So the reason is largely personal, I have used linkedin
alot and one more quite interesting thing linkedin played a very significant role
in my Career I created a very good network I would say and becasue of this platform
I reached out to the people and cracked many internships and one more thing
linkedin is only social/proffesional platform where i am available.
I do not have any instagram, facebook or snapchat.
I see LinkedIn as an ideal place where I can contribute to impactful
solutions that help millions of users connect, learn, and grow.

Next 5 years ?
I totally see myself advancing into a senior or leadership role
in the same company, where i can contribute not just as a developerbut also
as a mentor to my juniors and a decesion maker.
