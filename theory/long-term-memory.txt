1. Data Upsertion (Storage)
You store structured or unstructured data in a vector database. This typically involves:

Embedding the Data:
Convert text, images, or other data into numerical
vectors using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate).
Upserting the Data: The new data is either inserted if itâ€™s new or updated 
if an existing entry is similar.
ðŸ”¹ Example Process:

Extract knowledge (conversation history, documents, etc.).
Generate vector embeddings using a model.
Store the embeddings in the vector database.
2. Querying the Vector Database (Retrieval)
When a user sends a query, you:

Embed the query into a vector.
Search the database using similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product).
Retrieve the most relevant stored vectors.
Use them as context for generating responses.
ðŸ”¹ Example Search Flow:

Convert the query "What is AI memory?" into a vector.
Search the vector database for the closest matches (similar vectors).
Retrieve top N most relevant results.
Pass the retrieved data as context to the AI model for response generation.
3. Similarity Search Algorithms
Vector databases use various methods to perform fast similarity searches:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Fast, scalable approximate nearest neighbor search.
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs): Efficient for large-scale searches.
IVF (Inverted File Index): Partitions data for faster lookups.

4. Real-World Use Cases
Chatbots & AI Agents: Enhancing memory by recalling past conversations.
Recommendation Systems: Finding similar products or content.
Document Search: Retrieving relevant documents for knowledge-based systems.
