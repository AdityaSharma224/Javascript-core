Search and Filtering
Search events by keyword, date, or participant.
Filter events by calendar, status, or time range.

Non-Functional Requirements

Scalability
Handle millions of concurrent users and billions of events/invites.
Scale horizontally to accommodate traffic spikes (e.g., New Year scheduling).

Availability
Achieve 99.99% uptime (critical for a calendar service relied upon daily).
Use redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.

Performance
Event creation, updates, and invite responses should complete in < 1 second.
Calendar loading (e.g., monthly view) should render in < 2 seconds.
Low-latency synchronization across devices (< 5 seconds).

Reliability
Ensure no loss of event or invite data due to system failures.
Implement data backups and recovery mechanisms.

Consistency
Event and invite updates should be eventually consistent across distributed systems (e.g., slight delay acceptable for global sync).
Strong consistency for critical operations (e.g., avoiding double-booking).

Security
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., event details, user info) in transit and at rest.
Protect against unauthorized access with robust authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
Prevent invite spam or abuse (e.g., rate limiting invites).

Usability
Intuitive UI/UX for all platforms (web, mobile, etc.).
Accessible design (e.g., screen reader support, colorblind-friendly).

Interoperability
Support standard protocols (e.g., CalDAV, iCalendar) for integration with other systems.
API availability for third-party developers.

Maintainability
Modular architecture for easy updates and feature additions.
Comprehensive logging and monitoring for debugging and performance tracking.

Latency
Global users should experience minimal delay (< 200ms for local operations, < 1s for cross-region sync).
High-Level System Design Overview

Frontend
Web app (React/Vue), mobile apps (iOS/Android), and desktop clients.
Communicates with backend via RESTful APIs or gRPC.

Backend Services
User Service: Manages authentication, profiles, and permissions.
Calendar Service: Handles calendar creation, updates, and queries.
Event Service: Manages event CRUD operations and recurrence logic.
Invite Service: Processes invites, tracks responses, and updates calendars.
Notification Service: Sends emails, push notifications, and reminders.

Database

Primary Storage: Distributed SQL (e.g., Spanner, CockroachDB) for user data, events, and invites (strong consistency).

Cache: Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data (e.g., upcoming events).

Time-Series DB: For logging and analytics (e.g., Prometheus).

Message Queues

Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending notifications, syncing updates).

Load Balancer

Distributes traffic across regions and backend instances (e.g., Google Cloud Load Balancer).

CDN

Serves static assets (UI files, public calendar data) with low latency.

Synchronization Layer

WebSocket or long-polling for real-time updates (e.g., invite responses).

Background sync for offline support (e.g., mobile app caches).

External Integrations

SMTP servers for email invites/notifications.

APIs for third-party calendar syncing.

Example Workflow: Sending an Invite

User creates an event and adds invitees.

Event Service stores the event in the database.

Invite Service generates invite records and notifies invitees via Notification Service (email/push).

Invitee responds (accept/decline) via frontend → Invite Service updates status → Event Service syncs calendars.

Real-time updates pushed to all participants via WebSocket

Schema Design Notes
Primary Keys:
UUIDs or BIGINTs are used for scalability across distributed systems. UUIDs are preferred for sharding and avoiding ID collisions in a globally distributed database.
Indexes:
users.email: Unique index for fast login lookups.
events.start_time and events.end_time: For efficient range queries (e.g., "show all events this week").
invites.event_id and invites.invitee_id: For quick retrieval of invite statuses.
calendars.user_id: For fetching all calendars for a user.
Normalization:
The schema is normalized to reduce redundancy (e.g., separate users, calendars, events tables).
Denormalization could be applied in a read-heavy system (e.g., duplicating event titles in invites for performance).
Scalability Considerations:
Sharding: Shard by user_id or calendar_id to distribute data across servers.
Caching: Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., upcoming events) in Redis with keys like user:{user_id}:events.
NoSQL Alternative:
For a NoSQL approach (e.g., DynamoDB or MongoDB):
Store users, calendars, and events as documents with nested arrays (e.g., events within calendars).
Use a separate collection for invites with references to event_id.
Leverage TTL indexes for reminders to auto-expire sent reminders.
Time Zones:
TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE ensures proper handling of global users and daylight saving adjustments.
Recurrence:
recurrence_rule uses iCalendar RRULE syntax (e.g., "FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10"). Complex recurrence logic (e.g., exceptions) could be handled in the application layer or with a separate event_exceptions table.
