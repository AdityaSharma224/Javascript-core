1. Functional Requirements
Schedule jobs with specified execution times (one-time or recurring).
Distribute jobs across multiple worker machines.
Handle job execution, retries, and failure detection.
Provide an API to submit and manage jobs.
Trigger alerts in case of failures or SLA breaches.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Handle thousands/millions of jobs.
Fault Tolerance: Ensure jobs are not lost.
Consistency: Ensure exactly-once or at-least-once execution.
Observability: Logs, metrics, and alerts for monitoring.

3. System Components
API Gateway: Accepts job scheduling requests.
Job Scheduler Service: Queues jobs and assigns them to workers.
Distributed Job Queue: Stores pending jobs.
Worker Nodes (Executors): Executes jobs.
Job Status DB: Stores job metadata and state.
Alerting System: Sends alerts if jobs fail.
Monitoring System: Collects logs and metrics.


4. System Architecture
Client → API Gateway → Job Scheduler → Job Queue → Worker Nodes
                         ↳ Job DB (State Tracking)
                         ↳ Alerting System
- API Gateway
Exposes REST/GraphQL endpoints.
Handles authentication & rate limiting.

- Job Scheduler Service
Stores job metadata in Job DB.
Adds job to Job Queue (e.g., Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ).
Ensures correct distribution of jobs across workers.

- Job Queue (Message Broker)
Stores jobs until a worker picks them up.
Ensures durability and reliability.
Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS.

- Worker Nodes (Executors)
Fetch jobs from queue and execute them.
Reports success or failure back to the Job Scheduler.
Supports retries on failure.

- Job Status DB
Stores job execution status (Pending, Running, Failed, Completed).
Indexed for quick lookups.

- Alerting System
Monitors job failures and SLA breaches.
Triggers alerts via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

- Monitoring & Logging
Tracks job execution latency, failures, and resource utilization.
Uses Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for observability.


5. Scaling & Fault Tolerance
- Horizontal Scaling:
Add more workers to handle increased load.
Use a leader-election approach for the scheduler (e.g., using Zookeeper or etcd).

- Fault Tolerance:
Use job acknowledgment to avoid duplicate execution.
Retries with exponential backoff on failure.
Store job progress checkpoints.

- Consistency Handling:
At-least-once execution: Retry on failure but might cause duplicates.
Exactly-once execution: Requires idempotent job processing.


- API Endpoints
POST /job         -> Submit a new job
GET /job/{id}     -> Get job status
DELETE /job/{id}  -> Cancel a job

- Example Workflow
User submits a job via API → Stored in Job DB.
Job Scheduler picks job & places it in Job Queue.
Worker Node pulls job, executes it, and updates Job DB.
If the job fails, it retries based on a policy.
If retries fail, Alerting System triggers notifications.


Component	Technology Choices	Reasoning
API Gateway	Nginx, Envoy	Handles API requests efficiently. Nginx is lightweight and highly performant for load balancing, while Envoy is better for service-to-service communication in microservices.
Job Scheduler	Custom Go/Java Service	Go is great for concurrency and efficiency, making it well-suited for handling thousands of jobs simultaneously. Java offers strong multi-threading and ecosystem support, making it reliable for long-running distributed services.
Job Queue	Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS	Kafka is best for high-throughput and real-time event-driven architecture. RabbitMQ is ideal for reliable message delivery with retries. SQS (AWS) is a managed option, removing infrastructure overhead.
Worker Nodes	Docker, Kubernetes	Docker ensures job execution in isolated environments, making jobs portable and reproducible. Kubernetes helps in auto-scaling and managing workloads dynamically.
Job DB	PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis	PostgreSQL is strong for structured job metadata storage with ACID compliance. MongoDB is better for flexible document-based job storage. Redis is ideal for fast access to job state and scheduling with TTL-based expiration.
Monitoring	Prometheus, Grafana	Prometheus is an excellent open-source tool for real-time monitoring and alerting. Grafana provides powerful visualization for job execution metrics and system health.
Alerting	PagerDuty, Slack, Email	PagerDuty is widely used for incident management and escalations. Slack is useful for real-time team alerts. Email ensures persistent notifications for long-term tracking.
